# Nuclear leak detector
Created during the Greentech Tekno-Kamp of 2025. 
The goal was to build a model that could predict on historical data, which nuclear containers had a chance of leakage.

This Jupyter Notebook is the result of 6-10 hours of continuous coding during a hackathon, desperate to produce a result.
The code was used to analyze given data, sanitize it and train a model on it. 
And to visualise relevant data into plots.
